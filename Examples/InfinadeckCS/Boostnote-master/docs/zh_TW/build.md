## 環境

* npm: 6.x
* node: 8.x

## 開發

我們使用 Webpack HMR 來開發 Boostnote。

在專案根目錄底下執行下列指令，將會以原始設置啟動 Boostnote。

**用 yarn 來安裝必要 packages**

```bash
$ yarn
```

**開始開發**

```
$ yarn run dev
```

> ### Notice
> There are some cases where you have to refresh the app manually.
> 1. When editing a constructor method of a component
> 2. When adding a new css class (similar to 1: the CSS class is re-written by each component. This process occurs at the Constructor method.)

## Deploy

We use Grunt to automate deployment.
You can build the program by using `grunt`. However, we don't recommend this because the default task includes codesign and authenticode.

So, we've prepared a separate script which just makes an executable file.

```
grunt pre-build
```

You will find the executable in the `dist` directory. Note, the auto updater won't work because the app isn't signed.

If you find it necessary, you can use codesign or authenticode with this executable.

## Make own distribution packages (deb, rpm)

Distribution packages are created by exec `grunt build` on Linux platform (e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora).

> Note: You can create both `.deb` and `.rpm` in a single environment.

After installing the supported version of `node` and `npm`, install build dependency packages.


Ubuntu/Debian:

```
$ sudo apt-get install -y rpm fakeroot
```

Fedora:

```
$ sudo dnf install -y dpkg dpkg-dev rpm-build fakeroot
```

Then execute `grunt build`.

```
$ grunt build
```

You will find `.deb` and `.rpm` in the `dist` directory.
