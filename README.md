# Infinadeck SDK

Infinadeck is an Omnidirectional Treadmill (ODT) that allows users to walk unrestricted in any direction. 
This repository contains applications, libraries and game engine plugins to enable developers to create games and applications
that can utilize Infinadeck's one-of-a-kind capabilities.

## Instructions:

To utilize the Infinadeck SDK:

1. Install the `Infinadeck` application.
2. Add the appropriate plugin to its corresponding game engine, or create a native app using our API.
3. Start the `Infinadeck` application.
4. Start your application.

Using Infinadeck-enabled apps will also require a zero-configuration network utility for Windows, such as Apple Bonjour. This is NOT provided with this
package.

Using the Infinadeck desktop application and API-enabled software requires Bonjour, which must be downloaded separately. This will be included with the desktop application installer in a future update.

### Writing Native Applications

While SDKs are provided for most common game engines, you may wish to write 
your own applications that interface with Infinadeck devices. Included are 
header files containing all of the available functions, as well as example
code showing a handful of common uses. 

## Contact

We are always hard at work adding new functionality and improving the stability
of our software. If you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns, please
